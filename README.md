### Trevor Clark, Staff Software Engineer 

I’m a Staff Software Engineer with 15 years of experience designing and integrating complex robotic and electromechanical systems. My work focuses on computer vision, machine learning, AI, and automation, with a track record of delivering robust, real-world solutions in medical technology, space exploration, and educational technology.

I thrive in early-stage, open-ended problem solving—bringing a holistic systems perspective and a practical mindset to every challenge. My guiding belief: complex solutions don’t have to be complicated.
