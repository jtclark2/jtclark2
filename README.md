### Hi there! I'm Trevor. 

I love programming, machine learning, computer vision, robotics, and reinforcement learning!
I've worked with the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the Da Vinci Surgical Robot, eBeam Interactive Surfaces, and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider!
I've led teams and focused on individual technical contributions. 
My last job focused on software automation and computer vision. Recently, I've been deepening my knowledge of computer vision and Deep Learning. 
I love to learn and hope to continue learning and growing every day!
Check out my [website](https://jtclark2.github.io/) to see some of my more presentable / visually interesting projects, or dive straight into the code here at github to see all my ideas...including many that still have some maturing to do!
