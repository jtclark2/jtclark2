Hi, Iâ€™m Trevor Clark. 

I have an interest in computer vision and robotics. I've worked on the MRO (Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter) team,
an ed tech company that made interactive whiteboards/projects, and a large robotics med-tech company.
You will see bits of that in these repos, though I don't want to get sued, so most of the juicy stuff is omitted/private.

Over the last year+, I've focused full-time on learning ML/RL/Robotics/Games. 
I'm so thankful for the rich online communities and the availability of so many online learning resources that
have enabled me to continuously learning and grow.
